            <p> I am a passionate Visual artist,who loves to travel, write and take photos.
             Art and design have always been source of passion and inspiration for me, driving my commitment to continuosly expand my knowledge and skills in this field.
             The immense creativity found in art and design served as a tremendous inspiration for me to pursue higher education.
             Motivated by this inspiration, I enrolled in University to pursue a bachelor's degree in Visual Communication.
