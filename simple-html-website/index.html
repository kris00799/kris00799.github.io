            <p>I am a passionate Visual artist, who loves to travel, write and take photos. Art and design have always been a source of passion and inspiration for me, driving my commitment to continuously expand my knowledge and skills in this field. The immense creativity found in art and design served as a tremendous inspiration for me to pursue higher education. Motivated by this inspiration, I enrolled in University to pursue a bachelor's degree in Visual Communication.</p>

                <li>Travelling - For me, Travelling is a way of finding myself out there. I'm a person who actually love to wander, write, take photos. Once I came across a quote, that goes by this "Humans and trees were created on planet earth and humans were gifted with legs instead of roots to travel the world"</li>
                <li>Taking Photos - I solely believe that life is temporary and ART is forever and as a passionate individual about Art, I make photographs, which according to me is the only way to freeze time or a moment</li>
