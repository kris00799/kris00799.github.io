                <dd>Travelling - For me, Travelling is a way of finding myself out there. I'm a person who actually love to wander, write, take photos. I was deeply motivated by a quote, that goes by this "Humans and trees were created on planet earth and humans were gifted with legs instead of roots to travel the world."</dd>
